# Project Name: FOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# Description:
The Food Management System is an application that allows users to order various types of spicy dishes. They will be assigned a user name and password. Following that, one will be able to see all of the available food products. One item can be ordered at a time. After ordering one item, the user can choose whether or not to update what he has ordered. If this is the case, the order will be modified. If no, the order will be accepted. Following each order, the customer will be given the option of placing another order. This is the way the system works.
